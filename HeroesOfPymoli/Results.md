# Results: Heroes of Pymoli

In this analysis, we looked at the purchase records of 576 game players. We broke the players out by gender and age ranges in primarily 5-year intervals.

Once we looked at some measures along both of those dimensions, a few things became apparent:

 - While there are dominantly more male players than both female and gender-unspecified players, the latter has spent more money, both as a group per person and on average per person.
 - Players between 15 and 24 years of age together make up over 60% of all players who bought something. Players between 20 and 24 years of age spent more than their teenage runners-up, but the big spenders are kids under 10 and middle-aged adults between 35 and 39. Few people over 40 seem to be interested in purchasing anything in the game.
 - There is a direct correlation between total purchase value and purchase count. Both the popularity and profitability analyses show the same top 2 items and 4 of the 5 items on each of those lists appear on both lists. Yet the highest item prices did not top either list. This would mean that revenue is primarily driven by the popularity of items and less by whether they are individually priced higher.
